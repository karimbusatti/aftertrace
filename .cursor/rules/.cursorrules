# Aftertrace project rules

- You are working on Aftertrace, a web-first camera lab.
- It turns short user videos into trace/blob/optical-flow art and reveals how trackable the user is.
- Audience: 18–30, online, into visual experiments and slightly worried about surveillance.
- Design: Rick Rubin minimalism – remove everything non-essential, one big decision per screen.

When editing this repo:
- Read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and tasks.json if they exist.
- Keep backend in Python + FastAPI + OpenCV + Librosa.
- Keep frontend in Next.js + TypeScript, mobile-first.
- Prioritise clarity and simplicity over clever abstractions.
- Don’t introduce new libraries unless they significantly reduce complexity.
