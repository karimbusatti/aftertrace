Project: Aftertrace

- Web-first, mobile-first app that turns user videos into trace/blob/optical-flow visuals and shows how trackable they are.
- Design: very minimal, lots of space, one accent color, feels like a calm lab, not a marketing site.
- Tone of voice: thoughtful 20–30 y/o, online, a bit poetic but clear. No corporate buzzwords.
- Backend stack: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, OpenCV, Librosa (later MediaPipe).
- Frontend stack: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, minimal CSS/Tailwind, no heavy UI frameworks.

Rules:
- Always read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and tasks.json before big changes.
- Prefer a few strong presets over many weak options.
- Keep components small and well-named (StatsBlock, ResultPanel, PresetSelector, etc.).
- Do not introduce new libs without explaining why they’re necessary.
- Privacy by default: no accounts, delete videos after processing, no silent telemetry.
